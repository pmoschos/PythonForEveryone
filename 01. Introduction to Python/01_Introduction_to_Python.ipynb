This feature aids in debugging and development speed but can impact runtime performance.\n\n### 3. \ud83d\udd04 **Dynamic Typing**\nIn Python, types are determined at runtime, providing flexibility in coding. However, this can sometimes lead to runtime errors if not managed carefully.\n"

The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of packages that extend Python's capabilities.\n\n## Popular Uses of Python\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Data Science\nPython is a favorite among data scientists due to libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. These libraries provide robust tools for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 Web Development\nFrameworks such as Django and Flask make Python a powerful choice for web development. These frameworks simplify the development process by providing reusable code and components.\n\n### \ud83e\udd16 Automation\nPython excels in scripting and automation tasks. Tools like Selenium for web automation and Beautiful Soup for web scraping are popular among developers for automating repetitive tasks.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Artificial Intelligence\nLibraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch facilitate the development of AI and machine learning models, allowing Python to dominate the AI research and development space.\n\n## Getting Started with Python\n\n### Installation\nPython can be downloaded from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/). Installation instructions are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n### Writing Your First Python Program\n\n1. **Open a text editor or IDE.**\n2. **Type the following code:**\n"
